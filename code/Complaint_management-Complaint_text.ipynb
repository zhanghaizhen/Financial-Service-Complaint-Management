Please take immediate action on my behalf so I can have these items removed, deleted and permanently blocked from my credit report, so that I can get back on track to a normal life. \\n\\nRegards                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     27\n",
       "I have sent several requests to Experian requesting an investigation of my accounts. It has been months and I still have not received a response to my concerns. The only thing I have received is some automated rejection letter stating that they wo n't do anything to help me ( please see attached ). \\nThis has to be a violation of my rights. I feel like I 've already wasted so much time just trying to get Experian to look at the errors on my credit report and I 'm so frustrated that Experian is intentionally not responding to my inquiries. I need to have this issue resolved immediately. There are many things I need to do with my life and they all involve my credit. But I am not able to move forward all because of this credit bureau!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               26\n",

I 'm sure this could be a violation of my rights and Experian should not be deliberately disregarding my concerns!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           14\n",

       "In XXXX, I requested my free annual credit report. After viewing my credit report, I noticed over XXXX credit/loan inquiries on my account that was not authorized by me. I contacted each company and was told that there was not any account open under my information. I explained that I have a hard inquiry on my credit report and need it removed as soon as possible so that I could apply for a home. I was told that the inquiries would be removed from my credit report. As of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, none of the inquiries have been removed dating back to XXXX. I had a initial fraud alert placed on my report on XXXX XXXX, so if any credit reports are being pulled with my information, I was to be contacted by the company before any action was taken place. I just want the inquiries to be removed so that my scores and credit is not being impacted any longer. I would like to purchase a house, but until all of the inquires are removed I will not be approved with XXXX inquires on my credit report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      12\n",

My Social Security # is XXXX and my Date of Birth is XX/XX/XXXX in case it is needed to locate the fraudulent inquiry in their system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            11\n",

       "I am responding to a letter I received from Experian regarding a request made on my credit file. Based on my understanding of the letter, it looks like Experian is refusing to complete my request because they do n't think I am smart enough to write a dispute letter. \\nI would like Experian to know that I did in-fact send them a letter disputing information on my credit report. I also give Experian my full written consent to continue with the investigation of my accounts per the dispute letter I wrote to them. \\nI researched a dispute letter online and just used that to complete my dispute. So I guess it is possible that I may have missed something. I would very much appreciate Experian providing me with an explanation of my rights specifically pertaining to how I am allowed to dispute information on my credit report. \\nI would also like to know what made my letter \" suspicious '' and why Experian thinks I did not write my letter to them. Did I say something in my letter that was inappropriate? \\nI would like Experian to let me know if I am allowed to re-write my letter, and if so, would Experian be so kind as to provide me with an example of a letter that would be acceptable to them? \\nI do not have the money to be represented by an attorney or any other agency. I work all day and can not afford to take time off work to dispute my accounts. Would completing a dispute over the phone provide me with the same benefits as the letter? And if the results would be the same, why not just accept my letter?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   9\n",

       "While checking my personal credit report, I noticed an unauthorized and fraudulent credit inquiry made by XXXX on or about XX/XX/XXXX on Equifax. I did not authorized anyone employed by this company to make any inquiry and view my credit report. XXXX has violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 1681b ( c ). They were not legally entitled to make this fraudulent inquiry. This is a serious breach of my privacy rights. \\nI have requested that they mail me a copy of my signed authorization form that gave them the right to view my credit within five ( 5 ) business days so that I can verify its validity and advised them that if they can not provide me with proof that I authorized them to view my credit report then I am demanding that they contact the credit bureaus immediately and have them remove the unauthorized and fraudulent hard inquiry immediately. I also requested that they remove my personal information from their records.

       "I am responding to a letter I received from Experian regarding a suspicious request made on my credit file. Based on my understanding of the letter, it looks like Experian is refusing to complete my request because they believe the letter I wrote them was not sent by me. \\nI would like Experian to know that I did in-fact send them a letter disputing information on my credit report. I also give Experian my expressed and written consent to continue with the investigation of my accounts per the dispute letter I wrote to them. \\nSince I have not experienced this situation before, I would very much appreciate Experian providing me with an explanation of my rights specifically pertaining to how I am allowed to dispute information on my credit report. \\nI would also like to know specifically what made my letter \" suspicious '' and why Experian thinks I did not write my letter to them. Did I say something in my letter that they think I am not smart enough to write myself? \\nI have reviewed Experian 's website to determine what steps I am required to take to dispute my accounts and thought I had followed all instructions : I sent in a copy of my ID, proof of my social security number and proof of my address. I would be very grateful for a step by step explanation from Experian detailing the specific information I may have missed from their website. \\nI would like Experian to let me know if I am allowed to re-write my letter, and if so, would Experian be so kind as to provide me with an example of a letter that would be acceptable to them? \\nI am just a regular person and do not have the money to be represented by an attorney or any other agency. I work all day and can not afford to take time off work to dispute my accounts. So I would like Experian to tell me if completing a dispute over the phone would provide me with the same outcome as a letter? And if the results would be the same, why is Experian choosing to not accept my letter and my humble request for an investigation of my accounts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    7\n",
       "While checking my personal credit report, I noticed an unauthorized and fraudulent credit inquiry made by XXXX XXXX on or about XX/XX/XXXX on Experian. I did not authorized anyone employed by this company to make any inquiry and view my credit report. XXXX XXXX has violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 1681b ( c ). They were not legally entitled to make this fraudulent inquiry. This is a serious breach of my privacy rights. \\nI have requested that they mail me a copy of my signed authorization form that gave them the right to view my credit within five ( 5 ) business days so that I can verify its validity and advised them that if they can not provide me with proof that I authorized them to view my credit report then I am demanding that they contact the credit bureaus immediately and have them remove the unauthorized and fraudulent hard inquiry immediately. I also requested that they remove my personal information from their records. My Social Security # is XXXX and my Date of Birth is XX/XX/XXXX in case it is needed to locate the fraudulent inquiry in their system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   7\n",

       "A few months ago I requested my credit report from Experian. I got back this letter from them telling me that they received something that looked like fraud. I did n't get a chance to call them right away and I honestly thought it was some kind of mistake so I just went online and got my report from some website instead. \\nI ended up filing some disputes because there was incorrect and incomplete information on my credit report. So I prepared a nice letter and sent it with a copy of my driver 's license, proof of my social security number and proof of my mailing address so that Experian would be able to verify my identity. \\nIt has been at least XXXX months since I mailed my letter and I have n't heard back. When I try calling their XXXX number they want a report number before I speak with an agent and since I do n't have XXXX I ca n't speak to anyone. \\nI thought that the credit companies had to respond back to me within XXXX days otherwise they are supposed to remove things from my credit report?! \\nWell it 's been way more than XXXX days and all of the stuff I disputed is still there. I know I can go online and buy a credit monitoring service and try to dispute things online but I thought that Experian is supposed to help me for free! \\nI 'm at the point where I 'm done wasting time and need to get this fixed immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   6\n",

Hoping this process will make them take us seriously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       6\n",

I forward the details of these accounts in question and a copy of the Identity Theft Affidavit and I have had no response from both the credit bureaus and the creditor/collections agent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     5\n",

I 'm sure this could be a violation of my rights and Experian should not be deliberately disregarding my concerns!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    5\n",

I was unfairly charged massive late fees and compound interest during this time that was illegal for them to do so. I had contacted all of my creditors and sent them a copy of my orders because they are required by law to reduce interest rate to 6 %. Since then the debt from those credit cards has been sold and I can not get this issue resolved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           5\n",

       "I disputed inaccurate information with Experian regarding the accounts that are listed on this dispute. First of all, I 've contacted the companies via USPS certified mail and sent them a letter of debt validation. None of these companies responded with any verification or validation of the accounts or the information regarding the accounts. By law, these companies are supposed to verify to me that these accounts and the information is accurate. I would like to know what verification/ validation did Experian receive regarding these accounts that was competent since they say the investigated my dispute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",

       "They are almost impossible to reach. Their new customer friendly interface for consumers to update such ridiculous ad information that as a financial professional, it completely amazes me that the US Gov't who themselves can not be held up of a model of efficiency, can not seem to get what are very simple common sense facts regarding credit reporting that is set up to receive within those same fixed fields the exact same information they have received for decades. Moreover, there are secure and approved data filters that will remove garbage so as to at least give the appearance that the nation 's system of credit is not based on XXXX databases that if my people had two days, I could bring down the error ration from its present ( yet denied ) accuracy rate of if I am generous, about 65 %. And here is the real kicker, 90 % of those that pull a credit report and then use their algorithm to create a FICO Score, an algorithm hidden within the most secret places beneath the White House complete with a special decoder ring. Every piece of data that is considered to be unavailable due to national security, has been hacked and stolen long ago. But i do n't want to get off track by traveling down the multiple roads that have led to our systemic meltdown that is only being artificially propped up today by printing XXXX of XXXX of dollars and depositing it the next day. And yet be that as it may, out of the XXXX Credit Bureau 's, historically ( even though it is rarely brought up ), the Bureau with the WORST Database has always been XXXX! I simply had to laugh when I even read the first page a couple years ago and the addresses that were listed as addresses in which creditors would view that attested to where I have lived since maybe 1985, if they were n't actually used as a source of reference would cause anyone to simply just laugh. It is so obvious that ( and I have no idea what we are paying these people ) that there has NEVER been a time when Equifax actually attempted to at least set up within the fixed fields, what types of even characters would ever be there and simply start with that. Second, because this was dealing with the physical addresses of the consumer that it would EVER occur to anyone with the Federal Gov't Regulatory Agencies so suggest that they request copies of what was supposed to be identical data that made up these fixed fields and so the logical conclusion is that the data should either match or be pretty close. But NOOOO!. The government, which has become the arbiter of creating unethical conflict of interest exceptions which allow for these protected Credit Bureau 's to create products and sell this vaporware ( monitoring nothing subscription ) to the public. Now outside the beltway. those of us who remain that have not drank the kool-aid and completely sold out to the point where the term \" conflict of interest '', or \" unethical '' has no point of reference because the basis for any Standard was determined to be unconstitutional. In addition, Equifax who holds the golden trophy for possessing the most inaccurate database of any of the other XXXX, is the credit bureau of choice for most of those that extend credit. In addition, the appearance that a consumer can easily make changes just to their personal data so it is at least accurate and verifiable is fruitless. Once the changes are made, the consumer hits enter and is kicked out for any number of reasons. Primarily they use that due to security and lack of activity, the consumer has been timed out. Once that happens multiple times, you just give up. I have NEVER been able to reach a human to lodge a complaint or seek assistance, however, XXXX XXXX made all of my corrections and yet these so called bogus \" credit agencies '' which are simply a cover for the industry they represent continue to use them thus producing totally incorrect conclusions.      1\n",
       "Applied for Mortgage assistance with Fay servicing and recieved and offer of a loan modification by phone on XXXX/XXXX/15 and recieved written offer on XXXX/XXXX/2015. The new mortage payment under the TPP was more than I had been expecting at almost fifty percent of my take home pay. I consulted with my housing counselor who was unable to determine from the modification offer letter the type of modification i was being offered. My housing couselor then contacted my assisigned specialist at Fay servicing to enquire about the offer I had recieved. The specialist informed him that it was a propriortory, that the HAMP modification had been denied due to insufficant income and insufficant yeild. When my housing counselor asked him if a denial letter had been sent, he was told that no letter had been sent to me because they were able to offer me the propriotory modification. Because I was not sent a denial letter, and therefore did not know that my modification offer was not a HAMP, I was unaware of oppurtunity to appeal HAMP denial. Fay servicing specialist has advised me to appeal denial at this time however if a denial letter had been sent to me at time of HAMP denial, I could have appealed sooner and avoided delays in modification process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "Please refer to original complaint # XXXXXXXXBrief summary, I made final payment on HELOC on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$45.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX more than 7 years later, I get a notice of a lien hold on my house in the amount of {$36.00}. So I submitted a complaint to you. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I get a call from XXXX XXXX at XXXX xt XXXX confirming that there was never any communication made to me about outstanding fees. She stated the only communication they sent me was dated XXXX that the account was at a XXXX balance and instructions on how to pull more money out. She advised that the {$36.00} were fees when I closed my account, that the {$45.00} was interest and the reason that I was not told about the {$36.00} fee could be from the Wamu merger. She assured me that the lien would be lifted and she would send me a letter stating so. \\nI got her letter dated XX/XX/XXXX advising that this communication is an attempt to collect a dept. Which is in direct conflict to what she told me on the phone the day before. \\nI tried to log on to my account several times to file a dispute, however, can not log in.

I do have school loans which are also considered for the rejection of the re-financing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

       "My mortgage was bought out by M & T Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX. I pay my payment through bill pay and it is set up to be delivered to M & T Bank by a certain date. If it arrives XX/XX/XXXX or after they will charge me a late fee according to their statement. They have gotten my payment before XX/XX/XXXX and charged me a late fee on several occasions. I brought this to their attention and they have failed to refund the fees for all of the times they have charged me a late fee when it was n't late, according to their terms. It happens often that they charge the fee regardless. I usually pay my payment between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX the first years they had the contract, but now since they have been charging me a late fee regardless, and I ca n't get them to stop, I just pay it reluctantly with the late fee as part of my monthly payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
       "I applied for a loan with XXXX XXXX, was denied credit because my FICO score showed a pending bankruptcy with Trans union. This is incorrect! The bankruptcy is final and discharged on XXXX/XXXX/2008. I called Trans Union XXXX times! I cant understand any of them!!! Tell them to hire Americans, the ones that pay taxes in this country! They deny that it 's pending and the FICO score shows it is pending. I called FICO, they wo n't tell me nothing and tell me I have to contact the Credit Bureaus to change my FICO score. So what do! One denies the credit report and FICO wo n't give me no information! This is not right, If some organization is using a system to judge me, I should have the right to any information used on me!! I do n't know who to contact. I want my credit straightened out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

I have no single point of contact at Wells Fargo, I keep getting letters but when I call in to Wells Fargo I am transferred from person to persons who keeps telling me to send in documents or call back when I get my second lienholder to subordinate the loan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

       "XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC XXXXMERCHANTS CREDIT ASSOC. SCXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC XXXXRe : Social XXXXTo Whom It May Concern : I have attempted on multiple occasions to contact your company via XXXX yet you have failed to respond. At this time I feel it is necessary to file this complaint and advise you of the following. Due to your company violating FCRA ( Title 15 United States Code Section 1681 ), FDCPA ( 5 U.S.C. 1692 -1692p ), and UDAPP this letter will serve as my Notice Of Intent to File Suit. Pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated, Title 22, Ch. 3, Article 1, Sections 10-30 ; Title 22, Ch. 3, Article 3, Sections 110-320 ; Title 15, Ch. 7, Sections 10-30 ; Title 18, Ch. 7, Article 1, Section 20 ; Administrative and Procedural Rules for XXXX Court, Rules 1-19. I will be filing suit in South Carolina XXXX Court in the amount of {$20000.00} that is to include Statutory and Actual damages incurred by myself as a result of increased APR 's as well as out right denial of credit. As we XXXX know companies tend to wait until the suit is filed and wait until the last day before their answer is due to the court to offer settlement. I will advise you once the case is filed I will not even entertain an offer for settlement. I have already spoke with a law firm and advised them of the situation and if an agreement for settlement is not reached between myself and your company 14 calendar days from today he will be retained and take over the case in its entirety. But he will hold no settlement authority due to the disrespect your company displayed when ignoring documentation and request for validation of this fraudulent account. \\nYour company listed an account with XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$1600.00} on my credit. This account was opened fraudulently and I had notified the original creditor/rental agency as soon as I had seen them listed on my credit. Apparently they must have received the Fraud Affidavit and Dispute after selling it to your company. Never the less your company without mailing any documentation attempted to collect on this debt. FDCPA requires mailed documentation within 5 business days which to this day has still not been done. Now even after mailing the request for Validation of Debt and my letter of dispute for the XXXX time back on XX/XX/XXXX I have still have not received any response or correspondence. Yet, the account is still being listed on my credit as a derogatory account thus violating FCRA and FDCPA. \\nWhat I am proposing as an agreeable settlement would be your company immediately updates all XXXX credit bureaus to remove this charge off account as well as any associated inquiries and pays me {$5000.00} payment to settle any and all violations. Payment must be made to myself at the address listed above on or before XX/XX/XXXX. Considering the cost of hiring representation in South Carolina plus the cost you would incur for my court cost and attorneys fees I believe that is a fair offer. Once a settlement is agreed to I would be willing to sign a \" Release of all claims ''. As far as contacting me in reference to this offer for resolution I am giving you permission to speak with my husband XXXX XXXX at XXXX he can also be reached by email at XXXXXXXXXXXX.

       "Contacted Experian after getting a credit report from XXXX XXXX showing my Social Security Number for only their credit reporting agency was completely wrong. This caused a lot of negative reporting items to show up on my credit report and is keeping me from closing my loan. I sent proof of social security and my identification as well as a form from the social security administration. They claimed it would be taken care of immediately. I have been trying to get it resolved since XX/XX/XXXX. My loan is clear to close and still it has not changed with Experian and I am not able to close my loan. this is causing me financial distress. I have called in to Experian and have had my loan officer as well and each time they claim it will be fixed. When I asked them to send me proof its been changed they tell me they will send it and never do. I need this resolved right away!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
       "I was notify by my credit union of the writ of garnishment. They have put a hold on my account and my step-father account too. I do not recall this credit card account.

       "XX/XX/XXXX modification granted. Error made where late payments added to payments. Customer Account manager told my wife and I NOT to make a payment until they corrected it. Spent every month updating modification documents. Foreclosure proceedings began. The sell date was for XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX modification package was sent to Bank of America. Was told that the sale was stopped. The last notice of the sale was in the state paper on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX requests for validation of debt has been ignored. Told on XX/XX/XXXX house sold on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX found house on site listed as REO to be sold on XXXX starting bid at {$25000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX customer service managers assigned since XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX faxes sent giving the permission for Bank of America to discuss loan with my wife. XXXX appointments scheduled for customer account manager to call to discuss account. No calls received. Sat on hold for XXXX hours for one call XXXX times. Wrong phone number given on the loan modification status web site. An extension number was never given, without extension number call would hang up on my wife. Bank of America is guilty of breaking several laws : refusal to validate debt, dual tracking of a foreclosure ( packet in more than 37 days before the sale ), not posting notice in local paper, when posted it was in a state paper not widely circulated in our area more than 10 days before the sale. We were not properly notified of the foreclosure. The attorney 's letter was received almost 1 month after XX/XX/XXXX.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a money order in the amount of {$120.00} to XXXX XXXX for payment of a medical bill showing on our credit report. Enclosed with the payment was a letter of explanation to XXXX XXXX. Also on XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a money order in the amount of {$150.00} to XXXX XXXX for payment of a medical bill for my husband, XXXX XXXX showing on our credit report. Enclosed with the payment was a letter of explanation to XXXX XXXX. \\nOn Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called Revenue Collection to follow up on the XXXX payments since I had not received anything in writing as requested in both letters of XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with XXXX XXXX who informed me that XXXX XXXX handles only municipal collections and does not deal with unpaid medical bills for collection. XXXX XXXX stated that the XXXX payments in question had been posted to fines imposed by the City of XXXX for non-filing of business tax return in XX/XX/XXXX. I requested documentation to prove that the medical bill payments sent to XXXX XXXX where applied to the City of XXXX. XXXX XXXX offered to write a letter stating the payments were posted to fines imposed by the City of XXXX for non-filing of business tax return in XX/XX/XXXX. I declined this offer as proof. I requested that XXXX XXXX send me an internal record that showed this transaction had occurred with the City of XXXX. XXXX XXXX stated that she would have to call me back the next day. \\nI did not hear from XXXX XXXX on Wednesday, XXXX XXXX. Therefore, I sent XXXX XXXX an email requesting that the combined amount of {$270.00} be returned to us since they did not provide proof of payment to the City of XXXX. On Thursday, XXXX XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX XXXX, VP of Operations for XXXX XXXX XXXX ( see copy of email ). XXXX XXXX states that the payments made to XXXX XXXX was my error. XXXX XXXX is the bureau listed on the report for the unpaid medical bills. \\nOn XXXX XXXX, I visited the office for City of XXXX business tax issues. A representative examined my file and found that no payments had been made by XXXX XXXX. \\nAccording to Fair Debt Collection Practice Act 809. Validation of debts, ( a ) Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing ( 1 ) the amount of the debt ; ( 2 ) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector. \\nThe law does not specify which party needs to initiate communication. It is my position that initial communication with XXXX XXXX occurred about XX/XX/XXXX when the payments for unpaid medical bills were sent with letters of explanation. It is my position that XXXX XXXX should have sent written notice that the accounts referenced in the letters of XXXX XXXX were not in their possession. By law, this should have occurred within five days of the receipt of payment for the medical bills. It is my position that XXXX XXXX should have notified me in writing within 5 days of the receipt of payments for medical bills that they intended to pay the City of XXXX with the money orders clearly sent for a different purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
       "Do to health issues, loss of employment and a divorce I fell behind which sent me in to the foreclosure process. This started in XXXX, I made every attempt to get a loan modification. I was assigned a Single Point if contact, XXXX throughout the 3 yr process. I 've never spoken to XXXX them. I 've spend over 40 hrs on hold, being transferred to n fro from Dept to Dept. I ended up having to file bankruptcy to get them to work with me. This entire bankruptcy cost me more than my arrears. I finally got my loan modification in XXXX of XXXX. Thank you. But because I was still in the bankruptcy process I was n't allowed to make payments online. To make a payment by phone I 'm charged an extra {$15.00} per month. I 've been told for 3 months now I can pay online but when I try, I receive a msg telling me I have to call. Then I 'm charged extra, on hold and bounced to a minimum if XXXX depts and told I should pay online to avoid the {$15.00} charge. I 'd love to. I 'm very grateful to have gotten the loan modification and am doing great financially but feel I 'm still be prohibited from paying in a normal manner, and charged a bogus fee. This month I started trying to pay on the XXXX and was unable to get payment thru til the XXXX due to being bounced and on hold. I have to work, when I 'm available to hold for extended periods the phone lines are closed. Sometimes people really are trying. But the loop and hoop sytem puts them further behind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

This is reported on XXXX Equifax credit reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
       "Green Tree ( for Georgia ) I paid my {$1300.00} mortgage payment on XX/XX/XXXX, due XX/XX/XXXX, the same amount I always pay. However, escrow caused the amount to change. Therefore, I owe {$34.00} in addition to what I paid on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX, XXXX called me today, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX., threatened me, said if I did n't pay {$34.00} by the close of business today I would be charged {$54.00} late fee. And it would go on my credit. Why did n't he call sooner? Because he will take my money over the phone for a {$12.00} transaction fee. **So I must immediately pay {$34.00} plus {$12.00} payment fee, or be charged {$54.00} late fee. ** I did n't pay it. He harassed me about next month 's payment, when would I pay that, and it 's not due until XX/XX/XXXX. I make payments usually before the due date each month. \\nOnly one number for Green Tree : XXXX -- XXXX, XXXX is rude and wo n't help me, said I would be charged the late fee if the full amount of my mortgage payment was not received today, XX/XX/XXXX. I tried to get a payoff amount, and ca n't get that. I contacted the only other number I could find ( refinancing ) and they would n't even help me with a payoff amount! They hide like mice behind one phone number with very few options. Also my social security number is never recognized by this loan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
       "Our servicer, Select Portfolio Servicing in Utah, has requested require documents in order to negotiate a loan modification with the borrower. The borrower had received a completion notice from XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, saying within one month, the examination will be notified to the borrower. The notification to this effect has never been received thus far, whereas Required Information Notice has been numerously received by the borrower. SPS has been repeatedly extending the expiration date for submission of Required Information, and the latest notification said the date has been set for XX/XX/XXXX. However, the borrower has recently been receiving numerous solicitation letters from attorneys at law and other private companies that are offering legal assistance regarding violation of \" Dual Tracking '' and \" Single Point of Contact '' because they insisted public notice has it that non-judicial trust sale date has been set for XX/XX/XXXX. The borrower has not received the Notice of Sale from Select portfolio servicing yet XXXX has listed the property to be auctioned off on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX, Consumer Ombudsman Specialist at SPS wrote to the borrower with its carbon copy of XX/XX/XXXX addressed to CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL 'S OFFICE, saying \" Please keep in mind that each time documents are received an Acknowledgement Letter will be sent out. Once the processor has reviewed the documents another letter will be mailed out advising of documents that are needed or advising that we have a complete packet. '' See the last paragraph of the XXXX page of the said letter by XXXX XXXX as per attached hereto. Since XX/XX/XXXX, the borrower has submitted information numerously all along, but the said Acknowledgement Letter has never been received. The borrower has received Required Information Notices with pre-printed boilerplate letters containing all-encompassing documents. The borrower has never been able to speak to the so-called XXXX relationship managers, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, as a single point of contact, but more than a XXXX different people from SPS called the borrower, asking redundantly for already-submitted documents and information. The borrower finally gave up on talking to them on the phone and SPS notified the borrower stating they will terminate any verbal communication with borrower yet SPS calls numerous times without leaving voice mail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
